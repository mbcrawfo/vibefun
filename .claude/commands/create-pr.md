description: Create a PR, wait for CI and reviews.
---

1. Create a PR with the current branch.
2. Watch the PR until you see all github workflows complete.
3. If the CI workflow fails, investigate and correct the problems.
4. Look for code reviews and comments from claude and CodeRabbit.  If no reviews or comments appear, report the problem.
5. Carefully consider any suggestions from the comments and reviews. Make changes where necessary to address feedback.
6. If you do not take action on a comment, post a reply explaining your reasoning.
7. After pushing updates to the PR repeat steps 2-6 to address any followup comments or subsequent workflow failures.
