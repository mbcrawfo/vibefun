description: Create a PR and wait for Claude's review.
---

Create a PR.  Watch the PR until you see the CI build complete and a comment from claude with its review of the changes, as well as a CodeRabbit review.  If the CI build fails, investigate and correct the problems. Carefully consider any problems or suggestions from the claude and CodeRabbit reviews, and check for any comments left by the reviewers.  Make changes where necessary to address feedback.  If no reviews or comments appear, report the problem.
