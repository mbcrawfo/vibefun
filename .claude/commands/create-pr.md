Create a PR.  Watch the PR until you see the CI build complete and a comment from claude with its review of the changes.  If the CI build fails, investigate and correct the problems. Carefully consider any problems or suggestions from the claude review and implement changes where they are warranted.  If no review appears, report the issue.
