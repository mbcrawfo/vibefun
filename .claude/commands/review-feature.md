description: Review a feature plan for completeness.
---

Carefully review the $1 feature ($1-plan.md, $1-context.md, and $1-tasks.md).  Think hard about opportunities for improvement in the plan.

- Are there any gaps or missing details in the plan?
- Are there any open questions or ambiguous requirements that require investigation or clarification?
- Is there a thorough test plan to validate the functionality, including edge cases?
- Is all required work outlined in the task list and broken down into phases that can be implemented and tested incrementally?

Ask clarifying questions and perform any research necessary to improve the feature, then update $1-plan.md, $1-context.md, and $1-tasks.md.
