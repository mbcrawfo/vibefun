            # Incremental PR Review (Update)

            REPO: ${{ github.repository }}
            PR NUMBER: ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            PREVIOUS COMMIT: ${{ github.event.before }}
            NEW COMMIT: ${{ github.event.after }}

            This is an INCREMENTAL review. The PR was updated with new commits.

            ## Your Task

            1. **Review ONLY the new changes** since the last review:
               - Run: `git diff ${{ github.event.before }}..${{ github.event.after }}`
               - This shows only what changed in this update

            2. **Check previous review comments** (if any):
               - Run: `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} --comments`
               - Note any previously raised issues that may now be addressed

            3. **Provide focused feedback**:
               - Only comment on the NEW changes
               - Acknowledge if previous issues were addressed
               - Don't repeat feedback already given on unchanged code

            ## Review Criteria (for new changes only)
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Potential bugs or issues
            - Performance considerations
            - Security concerns
            - Test coverage

            ## Guidelines
            - Be concise - this is a follow-up review
            - If the update addresses previous feedback: "✅ Previous feedback addressed"
            - If new issues: list only NEW problems/suggestions
            - If update is good: "✅ Update looks good"
